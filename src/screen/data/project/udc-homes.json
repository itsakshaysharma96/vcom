Showcasing over twelve distinct designs — from hand-painted panels to intricately embroidered textures — each wallcovering was used in unexpected ways, highlighting the depth and adaptability of the collection while maintaining a unified design language.To elevate the experience, we paired these surfaces with custom-designed furniture, carefully curated art, and layered accessories. Every detail — from tonal variations to textural contrasts — was orchestrated to create a space that felt both intimate and impactful. The result was an immersive booth that captured attention while embodying the spirit of thoughtful, cohesive design."
